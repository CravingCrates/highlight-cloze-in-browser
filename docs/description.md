### USAGE

By default the add-on will highlight all search terms that aren't search operators. You can temporarily disable search highlighting by using the provided *View* menu entry, or its associated hotkey (`Ctrl+T, H`).

In addition to search highlights the following new hotkeys are provided in the search bar:

- Shift-Return: Jump to next result in current card list 
- Ctrl-Shift-Return: Select all results in current card list

### CONFIGURATION

The following settings can be configured by editing the add-on's source code:

- `HIGHLIGHT_BY_DEFAULT`: Wether or not to turn search highlights on by default
- `HOTKEY_HIGHLIGHT_TOGGLE`: Set hotkey for highlight toggle
